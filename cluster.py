To calculate kcse cluster points, we use the formular below

C = âˆš(X/48 * Y/84) * 48

where, C = Cluster Points
       X = points obtained in the four main subjects required in the course you want to do,
       eg computer science
       Y = total points of the seven subjects
       
       ***EXAMPLE**
       1. Nursing Course Cluster Calculation
        - Nursing course needs Biology, Chemistry, Maths and English as Compulsory subjects
          The subjects above when converted to points , eg A for 12, adds up to X in the equation above
          Lets say you got: Biology C+(7) History C+(7) Maths B-(8) English B+(10)  
          Your total X will be 
        -
